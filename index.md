## Who Were The Super Best Friends?
"Super Best Friends Play" was a Canadian-created "Let's Play"-style Youtube group that operated from 2010-2018, starring Matthew "Matt" Kowalewski, Patrick "Pat" Boivin, Liam Allen-Miller and Woolie Madden.

The group's videos have an absurdist sense of humor centered around Japanese and Western pop culture, with a healthy helping of outdated professional wrestling jokes. Their content typically featured lesser-known games from throughout gaming history, anything from poorly made bug-fests to high-end niche titles.

On December 16, 2018 it was revealed that the group would be disbanding due to internal conflicts. However, each member continues to create content on their own individual channels and social media outlets, while Pat and Woolie continue the group's former weekly podcast as the re-branded "Castle Superbeast". But what would become of all that sweet, sweet content?

## We Do It!
With the disbanding of the Super Best Friends Zaibatsu in December of 2018, the future of the group's wealth of content was uncertain. With the official Youtube channel no longer being updated, random deletions by Machinima, and continued issues with YouTube's content ID and copyright system, a group of scrubs decided to join forces to organize and preserve ALL the Zaibatsu's content in a single, easily-accessible collection.

To our knowledge, creating a complete archive of a YouTube channel this large has not been attempted before, so it is our hope that our experiences might serve as a blueprint for anyone else wishing to help preserve our digital past.

## Keeping the Archive Alive
In order to ensure the Archive's existence for as long as possible, we hope to eventually use several different distribution methods, including private servers, bulk storage dumps, and ~~torrents~~ (working on that). By distributing this content among multiple users, someone, somewhere will always be able to share it with anyone else who wants it, even if any official trace has been deleted. **Please do not use this as an alternative to watching the Super Best Friends official YouTube channel, and support the official releases, when available.**
