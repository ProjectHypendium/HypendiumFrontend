DISCLAIMER: While we have attained permission from all four Best Friends Zaibatsu members for this project, this archive is not intended to be a replacement for the official YouTube/Vimeo channels, or the Super Best Friendcast Libsyn. When possible, please support the official releases. Links for all official sources may be found at the end of this document.

- WE DO IT! - 

With the disbanding of the "Super Best Friends Play" YouTube channel in December of 2018, the future of the group's wealth of online content was uncertain. With the official channel no longer being updated, random deletions by Machinima.com, and continued issues with YouTube's content ID and copyright system, a group of scrubs decided to join forces to organize and preserve ALL the Zaibatsu's content into a single, easily-accessible collection.

To our knowledge, creating an archive of a YouTube channel this size has not been attempted before, so it is our hope that our experiences might serve as a blueprint for anyone else hoping to preserve our digital past.

- KEEPING THE ARCHIVE ALIVE - 

In order to ensure the Archive's existence for as long as possible, we will be using several different distribution methods, including private servers, bulk storage dumps, and torrents (working on that). By distributing this content among multiple users, someone, somewhere will always be able to share it with anyone else who wants it, even if any official trace has been deleted. Please do not use this as an alternative to watching the Super Best Friends official YouTube channel, and support the official releases, when available.

- Special Thanks -

With some Best Friends content already missing from official sources prior to compiling this archive, it might have all been lost without the help of the following users:

    Solidus - Machinima
    Bourbonne Black - Flophouse - Bible Black (Now available to Flophouse Patreons)
    RandomKid1015 - Hitman (2016)
    Brandon 'btsensei' Tang - Biker Mice From Mars
    SuperJesus4 - Let's Watch MGS4

We would also like to thank the editors of the SBFP Wiki, for providing dates and contributing to our content list; The Reddit users of r/DataHoarders and r/Torrents for putting up with all of our dumb questions; and especially scrublords like you, whose caring, dedication and hard work made this project possible.

And finally, a very special thanks to the Friends formerly known as Super Best: Matthew Kowalewski, Patrick Boivin, Liam Allen-Miller, and Woolie Madden. Thank you for all of the joy, chuckles and blunders you've given us throughout the years, and for your blessings to complete this project. We wish you all the best of luck in your future projects!
